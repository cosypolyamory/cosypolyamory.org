Recent selections have included foundational texts like "The Ethical Slut" and "More Than Two," as well as newer works exploring topics like relationship anarchy, solo poly, and intersectional perspectives on non-monogamy. We also occasionally read fiction that thoughtfully portrays polyamorous characters and relationships, or academic works that examine non-monogamy from sociological, psychological, or anthropological perspectives.\n\n💡 The discussion format encourages critical thinking, personal reflection, and respectful dialogue about different viewpoints presented in the readings. Participants often share how the book\'s concepts relate to their own experiences, challenges they\'ve faced, or insights they\'ve gained. We provide discussion guides and questions to help focus our conversations, but the dialogue naturally evolves based on what resonates most with the group.\n\n🍪 The book club serves as both an educational opportunity and a way to build deeper connections within our community through shared learning.

            'title': 'Communication Skills Practice',
            'description': '🗣️ Develop and refine the communication skills that are essential for successful polyamorous relationships through this practical, hands-on practice session that goes beyond theory to provide real-world application opportunities. This workshop-style event is designed around active participation, role-playing exercises, and guided practice of specific communication techniques that are particularly relevant to non-monogamous relationship dynamics.\n\n🎬 Participants work through common challenging scenarios that many polyamorous people face, such as discussing new relationship interests with existing partners, navigating scheduling conflicts, expressing needs and boundaries clearly, addressing jealousy and insecurity, and having difficult conversations about relationship changes. The session is facilitated by experienced community members who guide participants through various communication frameworks and techniques.\n\n💪 We practice both verbal and non-verbal communication skills, exploring how body language, tone, and timing all impact the effectiveness of our interactions. Small group exercises allow participants to work through scenarios in a supportive environment, with opportunities to try different approaches and receive gentle feedback from peers. We also explore communication challenges specific to polyamory, such as how to communicate effectively with metamours and ways to include all partners in important decisions.\n\n🌱 The practice sessions are designed to be safe and supportive, with clear guidelines about confidentiality and respect for all participants. Throughout the event, we emphasize that communication is a skill that requires ongoing practice and development, and we provide resources for continued learning and improvement. Participants often leave with specific techniques they can immediately implement in their relationships.'
