<h2>Hello {{ user.name }},</h2>

<p>Your application status has been reset to <strong>New</strong> in the Cosy Polyamory community system.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> As part of this reset, your previous application responses have been removed. If you wish to reapply for community membership, you'll need to complete a fresh application with new responses.</p>

<p>What this means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your previous application data has been cleared</li>
    <li>You can submit a new application if you choose</li>
    <li>The application process will start fresh</li>
    <li>You'll need to provide new responses to all application questions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you believe this change was made in error or if you have questions about reapplying, please contact the admin team for clarification.</p>

<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
