<h2>Hello {{ user.name }},</h2>

<p>We've reset your application status to <strong>Pending Review</strong> in the Cosy Polyamory community system.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> As part of this reset, we've removed your previous application responses. If you wish to reapply for community membership, you'll need to complete a fresh application with new responses.</p>

<p>What this means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can submit a fresh application if you choose</li>
    <li>You'll need to provide new responses to all application questions</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>
